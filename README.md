# OpenWebRX Launcher/Wrapper

OpenWebRX is a really excellent Web SDR software allowing remote SDR, but limited to the bandwidth or configurations that are setup initially.

These scripts are an attempt to wrap the configuration and allow for front end reconfiguring to change bands/systems.

You will need to allow permissions to the openwebrx directory to enable a swap out of the config_webrx.py configuration to allow for switching.

Sill very ALPHA at this stage, soon I'll separate the files into a more useful set of hackable scripts...

TODO...to allow for adaptability to enable/disable things like Spyverters via a GPIO on the raspberry pi if thats your thing.
